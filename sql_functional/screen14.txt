A given compiler might work like this:

* Tokenization (splitting up whitespace, simple substitutions)
* Parsing (figures out structure, like nested braces)
* Optimize the tree (the AST we get back from parsing
* Output

There might be more steps, like having intermediate languages, but we'll 
just worry about these.
