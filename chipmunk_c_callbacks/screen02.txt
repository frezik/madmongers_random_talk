Linking to a basic C function in xs isn't too bad:
\e[32m
    cpBB
    cpBBNew(l, b, r, t)
        cpFloat l
        cpFloat b
        cpFloat r
        cpFloat t
\e[0m
Typemaps:
\e[32m
    cpFloat    T_DOUBLE
    cpBB       T_OPAQUE_STRUCT
\e[0m
You can get 90% of a library setup by crudely parsing a .h library
